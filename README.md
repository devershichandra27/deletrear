# object-detection-using-Haar-Cascade
A simple python program to detect object using Haar Classifiers


It is a program that recognizes your gesture and performs tasks according to it. Recognizes when you smile. Opens your home directory when you display palm.


PS: People trying to find the logic behind the relation between palm and home directory will be shot. :-p
